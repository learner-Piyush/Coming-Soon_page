# Coming-Soon_page

<h3>This is my first "Coming Soon" project.</h3>

It contains HTML, CSS and an Image file. An image, a heading with a short paragraph, an Email field with a Submit button.

<ul>
<li>Here the container elements are being centred with the background is now color gradient.</li>
<li>The content element has been centred with respect to container (like Text and Image) and have a different background color.</li>
<li>Now, the form is aligned and the Email field which is required to fill.</li>
<li>But the Button comes with shadow, during hover it changes color with smooth transition and the cursor becomes pointer.</li>
</ul>
